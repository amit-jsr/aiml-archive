# AI Labs

AI/ML experiments, notebooks, and example projects created in past 

## Structure

  - `image_colorization_cnn.ipynb` — image colorization experiment using a CNN
  - `logo_detection_yolo3.ipynb` — logo detection using a YOLOv3-based workflow
  - `sales_prediction_ml.ipynb` — sales forecasting / weekly-sales regression baseline using retail train/test datasets and tree-based models

The repository intentionally keeps each project self-contained.
Each notebook has dataset notes, dependencies, and detailed instructions.

## Project Timeline
